			&lt;h1&gt;one of my students made me cry&lt;/h1&gt;

			&lt;p id=&quot;first-p&quot;&gt;I teach in a brilliant school in the UK - not a private school, but somewhere the kids are almost universally excellent. I realised that something was wrong very quickly with you. You were once a happy, radiant girl. You were top of the school academically, friendly, popular. Even now, in your last year of school, you had dreams of being a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;But every now and again I&#39;d see your lip quiver in class. It would take you slightly too long to respond to question. Your shoulders were more hunched than your usual confident gait.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I asked you to stay behind after class. You must have thought you were in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We spoke for hours that evening, just you and I, sitting at a pupil desk. I stayed long after I said to my wife I&#39;d be home, holding your hand, just listening. We spoke about everything. TV. Sports. How my favourite chocolate bar was a Wispa, but you thought they were too bubbly. We spoke about a condition. A condition I know very little about, but one I&#39;ve since read almost everything Google has to say about it. Russell&#39;s sign. Ever so slight tooth decay. Weight loss. Low self esteem. Suicidal thoughts. You didn&#39;t want your parents to know.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We managed to get you therapy. Every two weeks you&#39;d attend a class, and I&#39;d be the first person you&#39;d report back to. Trying food diaries. Replacing your bad thoughts with positive ones.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;You got better. It took 6 months. Tears, rages, you swore at me more times than I can count, several times I kept you in my class after hours because I knew if I let you go home you&#39;d do something stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;But damn it, you got better.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Two days ago I came to your Leavers Prom. You looked gorgeous, healthy, radiant. I&#39;ve never seen a student smile so wide and so often. You asked me to dance - I felt you squeeze my hand as we twirled to the music.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was your Leavers Day. You came in to my class for the last time, on your own, clutching your accepted offer to university. I told you I was proud of you. I am so damn proud of you.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I outstretched my hand and wished you the best of luck. You pushed it out the way and came in for a hug. I don&#39;t know how long it lasted, but these hugs are ones you don&#39;t put a time limit on.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Just as you were about to leave you said you had a gift for me, to say thanks for the support. Some of my students have given me expensive gifts over the years - champagne, whisky, luxury food baskets and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;You handed me a single Wispa chocolate bar. I have no shame in saying I broke down and cried in front of you. I broke about a thousand school rules by squeezing your hand, kissing you on the cheek and saying thank you. It&#39;s the best present I&#39;ve ever received.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p id=&quot;last-p&quot;&gt;Good luck kid. Go be the best damn doctor you can be.&lt;/p&gt;
